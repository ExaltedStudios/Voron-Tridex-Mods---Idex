# Voron-Tridex-Mods---Idex
Some mods I have modeled in fusion for Eddie's Voron Tridex franken-printer. For more details, I recommend checking it out here: https://github.com/FrankenVoron/Tridex

# What's what? 

## Multicolored Tridex Front Skirts

#### These are up to date and do not need supports to be printed. Enjoy. Both single color and multi colored STLs are available. To split the mulit-colored STLs, 'split to parts' in Superslicer. 

## Smol Filters:

Just like the stock Voron Trident filter, just small. You will need to keep in mind that these require two slots in your panel. Not a problem if this is your first time cutting. They are built directly from the stock model. You can cut the existing trident BOM filters to fit.

## Front Idlers:
### PLEASE NOTE: I used Eddie's base model for this design, and did not realize the nubs were missing from one of the idlers. I've fixed them just need to get everything reuploaded.

### Wide Front Idlers:

These would really only be intended for someone planning to do an unenclosed build. Otherwise, you would need to use magnetic panel mounts on the outside of the entire frame. Up to you! 


### Tall Front Idlers:

Because why not make a tall version if you're making a wide version? This would allow you to still use Eddie's panel setup. 





#### Disclaimer: 
##### As a warning, there is not always a clear purpose to the mods I do. Sometimes I just get overly curious and make something. Part of the reason I am uploading these at all is to learn how Github a bit more. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. 

It seems implied due to the nature of Tridex itself, but the team behind the original CAD and parts is: vorondesign.com
